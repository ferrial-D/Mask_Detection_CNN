# Mask Detection with Deep Learning
This project involves building a deep learning model for detecting whether a person is wearing a mask or not, using images. The dataset is processed using Python libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow's Keras API. The model is trained on images of people with and without masks and can be used for real-time mask detection.
# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify images as either with mask or without mask using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is built using the Keras API in TensorFlow, and it uses images preprocessed to a uniform size.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of two categories of images:
With Mask: Images of people wearing masks.
Without Mask: Images of people without masks.
The images are resized to 128x128 pixels and converted to RGB before being passed to the model.
